12-14-2003:
	-changed something in P_CreateBlockMap(): for (i=0; i<(unsigned)numvertexes; i++) // No, make the other one unsigned! Graue 12-14-2003

12-16-2003:
	-fixed score adding in CTF; in normal score, flag capture didn't add player points; pointlimit wasn't checked in either scoring mode
	-made P_CheckFragLimit() just check both teams in CTF mode, probably faster

12-17-2003:
	-flag capture isn't supposed to add player points (NOW they tell me!)

12-18-2003:
	-added animated textures SFALL1-SFALL4 and BFALL1-BFALL4
	-removed them again for the time being

	-preliminary work on multiple linedef executor trigger types

12-20-2003:
	-added linetype 97, linedef executor trigger once per floor hit
	-minor fix for custom exits on FOFs, linetype 71 is searched from FOF control sector now
	-removed electrical damage (18) and CTF bases (983-984) from the list of sector types that activate without floor touch in P_PlayerInSpecialSector
	-took out redundant check for linetype 321 in speed pad handling (P_ProcessSpecialSector, sector types 976-977)
	-took out redundant, broken, and commented-out code for linedef executor specials 101 and 102 in P_ProcessLineSpecial
	-workaround for bad bug in EV_DoElevator? for elevateContinuous, elevator->low was in an if statement but never got set to anything
	-fixed bug with skipline and custom exits in P_SpawnSpecials
	-made new sector type 974 for linedef executor, doesn't require touching floor

12-21-2003:

12-22-2003:
	-comment out player cmomz and rmomz, currently not being used
