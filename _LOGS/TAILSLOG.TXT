I decided to start a log of my progress here so others could catch on to what I was doing.

After tireless hours of constant fiddling with the Z checking trying to get the Z damage
code to work, exhausted, I scrolled down a bit more and found a large commented area
explaining all the new variables! After I knew this, I was able to implement a simple
Z damage code with only TWO LINES OF CODE! I AM ECSTATIC!! YES!

Beefed up the Techno Hill Zone Textures today. Started on the backside running animation
of Sonic. StroggOnMeth added a ton of new stuff to the damage code, and I had to tidy it up.
Turns out that his JUSTJUMP Mobj didn't work, so I used JUSTHITFLOOR and everything's
dandy now. Spring also works, too, but have yet to give Sonic a spring animation and
play a spring sound.
