CVS-RULES

- As you can see, there is sub-directory in the repository, one for eatch 
  platform (djgpp (dos),win32, linux) the root directory is for all platform,
  so take care of the order we have put in.
- do not commit/upload tests of bugged code, try to fix a maximum of know 
  bugs and update know bugs list in source.txt. If you must commit your source 
  make your code in #ifdef so we can disable it
- legacy is a modification of doom source and the main goal is to keep doom 
  gameplay, so gameplay must not be changed ! We allow additionnal feature 
  (until it not change gameplay) and visual addition. Read the legacy 
  first-look page on the main site
- Send a little mail on mailing list, so eatch time you do a commit everyone 
  know what'new in repository
- Maximize communications between members, do not impose your changes, if your 
  are not sure about a feature/change, talk about it in mailing list.

CODE-RULES

- We use no tab, 4 space indent, and tab size 8 (in case some tab have filtred 
  and for makefile)
- Self documented code, variable and function must have a name that help 
  understand the code, so do not call varibale and function a,b, a2, ...
- the usage of extern in a c file is prohibited, except for declaration of a 
  function with body (so it is like public keyword in c++)
  Also function protos haren't allowed for external function, put it un the 
  corresponding h file.
- Try to minimize #ifdef usage for :
  - code readability
  - the main code is for all port so if something is good for a platform all 
    platform can benefit by this feature
- Take care of platform dependent code, we would like to have code that work 
  on Dos, Win32, linux, ... little and big endian, software/Glide/OpenGl.
  
GOOD PRACTICE

- Try to put as mush static variable and function on module so it help to 
  understand the role of the varaible/function in the module also this 
  help the compiler to optimize
- minimise global variable
- make a log of your work, so you don't need to put a lot of comment in 
  the code, this will also help us to update the what's new section of doc 
  when doing final release
