 [1] INTRODUCTION
 ----------------

  Hello all Doom fans of the world, here is the latest release of
  Doom LEGACY project by Fab & Boris (we still didn't found a name
  for our team, let's say it is 'Fab & Boris').

  Well, if you are reading this you probably know by now that the
  gods at IdSoftware have released the sources of the greatest game
  on earth : Doom !!

  Of course a lot of projects have started around the sources since
  about January 1998, and Doom LEGACY is competing to be the best of
  the choices!

  We have always dreamed of Doom sources being released, and all the
  features that we'd like to add. Since Doom1 was out we are fans
  of deathmatching. Don't ask us why we like it more than Duke Nukem
  or other clones, we like the atmosphere of Doom and its like that!

  This new version of Doom is not commercial anymore, but you should
  have the original Doom2 data (doom2.wad and other files), that comes
  with the original Doom2 software.

  If you have problems running this version or want more informations,
  first: READ THE FAQ. If the FAQ doesn't help, mail us at:
  legacy@newdoom.com

  We hope that this new version brings you a lot of enjoyment,
  especially for the deathmatch fans out there.

  Have much fun!!


 [1-1]: What's new
 =================

     See whatsnew.txt for the latest changes.


 [1-2]: What's coming
 ====================

     We have planned other features. See our site:
     http://www.newdoom.com/doomlegacy



 -------------------------------
 [2] INSTALLATION OF DOOM LEGACY
 -------------------------------

  Doom Legacy is a addon of one of the idSofware games : Doom,
  Doom II, Ultimate Doom, Final Doom or Doom Sharware.
  So it should be installed in the directory where you have
  one of the previous version of Doom.

  It won't replace any existing file from the original Doom.

  Doom Legacy will run in the mode of the original Doom version
  where it is installed. That is, if you have installed Legacy in
  Ultimate Doom directory, it will act like Ultimate Doom, pro-
  viding 4 episodes, and no super shotgun.

  Under Windows, you have a additionnal launcher, to configure
  Doom Legacy. In game mode menu you can configure the game between
  Doom, Doom2, Ultimate Doom, ... Just put the corresponding wad.


 [2-1]: Setting up the game
 ==========================

     Legacy doesn't use SETUP.EXE anymore, it uses 'config.cfg' now.
     There won't be anymore problems with the original Doom config
     file 'default.cfg' : it will never be changed.

     To configure your original Doom, use SETUP.EXE.

     Under windows you can use the launcher to configure and launch
     more easely Doom Legacy.


 [2-2]: Setting up the controls
 ==============================

     Setting up the controls, mouse and joystick, video mode is done
     while in the game, using the main game menus : Setup Controls,
     Video Options, Game Options. You can change all game settings
     at any time during the game, forget about SETUP.EXE !!

     The mouse will be activated as default, to disable it, change
     the 'use_mouse' variable in the console (see console.txt)

     The joystick will not be used as default, set the 'use_joystick'
     variable at the console, to one of the joystick types supported
     by Legacy (up to 6button joysticks + hat, see console.txt)



 [2-3]: Setting up the sound
 ===========================

     WINDOWS: The sound is autodetected using DirectX so make sure
     -------  you card wortk well with DirectX and it legacy will
              us it.

     DOS:
     ---

     The sound and music card is auto-detected at the game startup.

     If you don't get any sound in Legacy, check that the BLASTER
     variable is set. Type 'set' at the dos prompt (or dosbox under
     Windows) : do you see a line like 'BLASTER=A220 I5 D1 ...' ?
     If not, run the installation of your soundcard for Dos mode,
     it will usually modify your autoexec.bat so that the BLASTER
     variable will be set. See the FAQ.TXT for more.

     If the BLASTER variable is set, but you still don't hear any
     sounds, or the sounds are not right, then edit the SOUND.CFG
     file, and manually set your type of soundcard, see there for
     more.



 [2-4]: Tuning up the mouse speed
 ================================

     The main Options menu still limit the mouse sensitivity value
     to a 'normal range', but you can now increase this value even
     more using the console variables 'mousesens' and 'mlooksens'.

     If you used to edit default.cfg for the mouse sensitivity,
     forget about it and use the console!



 [2-5]: the Setup Controls menu
 ==============================

     You don't need to use the SETUP.EXE now, there's that cool
     'Setup Controls' menu.

     Using this menu is pretty straight forward, you can bind actions
     to one or two keys, like in Quake.

     A single key can be set to multiple actions, eg: go backward and
     'use' at the same time.

     To CLEAR the keys attached to a control, use the BACKSPACE key.

     To setup the DOUBLE CLICK for mouse/joystick buttons : enter the
     click one time, so that it displays, eg: 'MOUSEBUTTON1'. Then
     re-enter the click a second time, and it will transform into a
     dbl-click, eg: 'MOUSEBUTTON1' will become 'DOUBLEMOUSE1'.

     You can use double-clicks for any joystick/mouse button, and you
     can even attach any action to it, eg: strafe left/right with mouse
     buttons, it works. Just enter the button two times like said before.

 [2-6]: Using a Second mouse
 ===========================

     Doom Legacy supports a second mouse on the SERIAL port, to allow
     both players in split-screen mode to play with a mouse.
     This mouse should be MS-Compatible or Logithech.
     The menu related to the secondary mouse is in the player two
     configuration menu (from the mutliplayer menu).
     Plug the mouse in one of your serial ports (COM1/COM2/COM3/COM4)
     then go to the menu and set FIRST mouse2port to the port you have
     plugged the mouse in, then switch "use secondary mouse" to On.
     It should work :).

     Problems :
     ----------
      - Under Windows, the secondary mouse MUST NOT be detected by windows.
        Make sure it is not connected to your computer until Windows
        has finished to startup, then connect it. If you let the secondary
        mouse connected during the boot, WIndows will detect it and will
        want to install drivers for it, which is what you DON'T want! :)
        Doom Legacy handles itself the secondary mouse, without
        the need of an additional mouse driver.
      - If the secondary mouse is not detected by Doom Legacy, and you
        are sure the mouse is well connected to the serial port, toggle
        "use secondary mouse" to 'force' in the game menu. This will
        skip the detection and assume the mouse is there.

     Note:
     -----
     - Here we considere you have already one mouse, your abitualy mouse
       and then you add one other mouse in the serial port. Your normal
       mouse is used with there driver. Therefore you can use wathever
       mouse you whan (USB, PS/2, ....) for your first mouse. But use a
       serial mouse for the second mouse.

 -----------------------------
 [3] ADDITIONS TO DEATHMATCHES
 -----------------------------

 [3-1]: Shooting up and down
 ===========================

     There's nothing changed, except of course a totally new
     deathmatch experience.


     About the BFG : the bfg ball can be fired up or down, but
     the invisible rays that spray from you are totally independent of
     your aiming. The invisible BFG rays have always 'autoaim', they're
     not dependent of your aim. Let's be clear: apart from being able
     to shoot the BIG BFG BALL up or down, the side-effect of the BFG
     is like before.


 [3-2]: Auto aim toggle
 ======================

     We wanted to keep the compatibility with the older Doom gameplay,
     but we needed also to go forward and bring some more depth to the
     deathmatches. On of these steps, is going for the manual-aiming.

     You may feel like it's unbalanced if some people use the autoaim,
     as they don't have to do the effort of aiming right, and others
     don't use it and do their best to aim up and down right...

     NEW since Legacy v1.2 : with allowautoaim (see console.txt) , you can
         disable autoaiming, that is, impose manual aim to all players
         in a network game, use with caution!!


 [3-3]: Weapon changes
 =====================

     We didn't dare of course change the existing weapons functionality!

     You may appreciate however, the fact that you can remap every
     weapon to any key, in the Setup Controls menu. Since you can map two
     keys per 'control', you can keep the original keys '1'-'8' for the
     weapons, and add a shortcut to your preferred ones. eg: '5' and 'r'
     for rockets...

     New weapons are planned in the future releases: probably a grenade
     nearly like Quake1 ones. Maybe an addon for the rocket launcher to
     transform it into a 'guided rockets' launcher... like the Revenant's
     fireballs.


 [3-4]: New cheats
 =================

     'idcd##' : Will work only if MSCDEX driver is loaded.
                Similar to the 'idcmus##', but for CD Audio tracks.
                Example : idcd02 start cd track 2.

     'idfly'  : Fly around levels, using 'jump' key to get altitude.

 [4] THE CONSOLE
 ---------------

  Check 'console.txt' documentation for more about the console.



 ------------------------------
 [5] NETWORK GAME (MULTIPLAYER)
 ------------------------------

 IMPORTANT NOTE!

  NEW, since Legacy v1.2, the network part of Doom has been totally
       rewritten. It now uses a better transfer method for the packets,
       (which is usually faster), and also implements a basic
       Client/Server model, where some critical game options are
       changeable only by the server in multiplayer games.

       Since the network communication is faster, we have upped
       the number of players to 32 !!

 [5-0]: Network under Windows and Linux
 ======================================

     The win32/Linux version of legacy no more work with external
     program like sersetup, ipxsetup, dm, doomatic, hx8, .... This
     version use directely winsock/socket api. So the only way to
     play in network is to use the -server and -connect parameter.
     Or use the launcher who has beautiful interfase that will
     translate your wishes in command line.

     The follow is ONLY for dos version.

 [5-1]: Quick-start of a 5-32 players network game (DOS only)
 ============================================================

     To start a game with more than 4 players, we recommend using
     Doomatic. Doomatic is a utility written by us before the source
     release, we wanted to create a deathmatch launcher with all the
     features that we always needed.

     It replaces IPXSETUP and DM. Just read the 'QUICK START' sec-
     tion of DOOMATIC.TXT file to get started with Doomatic.

     Since we've added more than 4 players support into Doom LEGACY,
     we have modified DOOMATIC to allow starting games with up to
     32 players.

     Make sure that the map you use has enough deathmatch starts!

     Search on internet Doom sites, there has been a number of wads
     specifically made for the new Doom ports with more than 4 players.

     Cooperative play with more than 4 players should work with map
     using the JDS cooperative player starts.


 [5-2]: the new Client/Server model
 ==================================

     The network code has been totally rewritten, here are the
     main changes:

     - Doom Legacy version 1.2 supports up to 32 players.

     - The speed is now dependent from the Server. if the server looses
       frames, that is: if it runs too slow, all the other players will
       experience the slow down, or 'choppyness'.

       Thus, make sure that the server's machine runs smooth, example:

       a P100 running the game at 320X200 may be very smooth. while
       a PII 300 at 1024x768 will slow down the network. Why? simply
       because while the server is occupied drawing his screen, he can't
       send or receive any packets, and thus the other players are slowed
       down at the speed of the server (well, now it is possible that
       a PII 300 is very smooth at 1024x768.. but you get the idea).

     - The memory is very important so 16 Mb is a MINIMUM for a server.
       Why? Because a server with not enough memory will often load
       data from the disk, and this will probably slow down the game.

     - Don't forget to put a very good disk cache, like 4 Mb or more.
       A good disk cache will reduce the loading from the server, thus
       reduce possible slow downs.

     - The server can kick any player ouf of the game. The player will
       be returned to the title screen.

     - Consistancy failure now kicks only the player who was not
       'up-to-date', but not the others.

     - Parameters -left -right came back (using 3 screens for left,right
       and front views).

     - Most critical game variables are send to all the players when they
       are changed by the server, and only the server can change them.

       Examples are 'allowjump', and 'respawnitemtime'

     - The new possibilities are barely demonstrated in Legacy v1.2 :
       we can now make any console command work on the network, so there
       are very good things ahead!

     For MS-DOS, the new system is still compatible with IPXSETUP and
     SERSETUP, so you can use these to play games up to 4 players.

     To play with up to 32 players, use DOOMATIC.

     Note that DOOMATIC was created by us long before the release of the
     Doom sources, and it works with the orginal Doom, and with most
     other ports, too. We didn't create DOOMATIC specifically for Legacy,
     but we updated it so that it could start games with more than 4
     players for Legacy.



 [5-3]: Setting up the SERVER (DOS ONLY)
 =======================================

     There is no interface for now.

     The server is the player 0, which is the GREEN player in DOOMATIC.

     Note that the GREEN player in Doomatic, is not necessarily Green
     later in the game : the server can choose any color in the
     Multiplayer menu. Legacy doesn't use the colors from Doomatic,
     but will recognise the Green player of Doomatic as the server.

     In other words, you can't choose who is the server using IPXSETUP.

     We reassure you: this is a hack, and we will add a '-server'
     parameter as soon as possible to determine explicitly the server.

     The color you choose in Doomatic is useful for the original Doom
     game only : it was a key feature of Doomatic, to choose the colour
     you wanted to be instead of getting always the same color from
     IPXSETUP. It became obsolete with Legacy, as you can choose your
     color in the game itself.

     The SERVER has more rights in the game, and no, it can't cheat.
     It can change the game parameters like 'repspawnitem','respawn-
     monsters', ect. and can Kick players. Therefore, choose the server
     with attention.

     NOTE that there is no 'dedicated' server for now, everybody in
     a multiplayer game and even single player, is always a server
     and a client at the same time. That is: in single player, you
     can slow down yourself, when you loose frames, usually in the
     higher resolutions, you will experience a small 'lag' like on
     a 'choppy' multiplayer game.

     See CONSOLE.TXT for more about the server & multiplayer commands.



 [5-4]: the return of -left/-right
 =================================

     We have restored the -left and -right command-line parameters,
     that allowed in the earlier versions of Doom, to play using
     3 monitors: one for the front view, one for the left, and one
     for the right.

     Here is how it works:

     Use DOOMATIC and create a game on the machine that will display
     the 'front view'. Make sure it has the GREEN player color
     (in Doomatic, not in Legacy). Set '-left' and '-right' in the
     local parameters of Doomatic, for the other two machines.
     That is : the 'left view' machine has '-left' in the local
     parameters of Doomatic, the 'right view' machine has '-right'.

     Join the game with the other two computers, and start the game.

     This will work only for SINGLE player, but the player will have
     a very wide view!



 [5-5]: How to play with tcp/ip
 ==============================

     Someone will be the server, it is usually the fastest computer.

     A client NEVER slows down the server, but a slow server
     SLOWS DOWN ALL THE CLIENTS!

     The server types:

     > legacy -server <# of computers>

     Clients are the other players who join in the server:

     > legacy -connect <ip address of server>

     or

     > legacy -connect
       This will auto-detect a server on a LAN. This only works when
       computers are directly connected. If you play through internet,
       the server can NOT be auto-detected, and you must specify it's
       IP address.


     Example A, 3 players on a LAN:

       player 1 (the server)
       > legacy -server 3

       player 2 (client)
       > legacy -connect

       player 3 (client)
       > legacy -connect

     Example B, 2 players, through internet:

       player 1 (the server)
       > legacy -server 2

       player 2 (client)
       > legacy -connect xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx

     Example C, a 3 player game, with _TWO_ computers, one is split-screen:

       player 1 (the server)
       > legacy -server 3

       player 2 and 3 (2 clients on the same computer)
       > legacy -splitscreen -connect


     You don't need to put all parameters on the client side like :
     -deathmatch, -warp xx, -respawn, -fast, etc because the server
     automatically sends those to all clients upon connection.

|    Also the -file parameter is no needed anymore. The server will send
|    all file needed by the client, let's say rather the client will
|    download it from the server. But of course client will first check if
|    file is not in the directory or subdirectory.

     Use '-notime' to disable file date check on clients. Normally
     the game will warn you if a client has a file loaded by the
     server, but with a different date. Clients should have the exact
     same version of the files added by the server.

     You want to know some things : you need a good ping value, perfect
     is less than 30, more than this will be very unplayable, because
     there is not, for the moment, code to reduce the latency between
     command entered at keyboard and command execution.

     In other words, Doom Legacy doesn't use 'interpolation' to make
     you believe like the game is 'smooth' when it is not in reality.



 [5-6]: Playing Legacy over modem (MS-DOS ONLY)
 ==============================================

     DOOMATIC, doesn't support modem play as today.

     There are several problems with the original SERSETUP. And with most
     of their equivalents like SER7-5 and others.

     We no more support the original SERSETUP and recommend using 'HX8'.

     We have currenlty only received positive feedback with 'HX8' :
     people have succesfully played Doom Legacy in serial, even with
     8 players using 'daisy-chain'. It was told to us that using more
     than 2 players and modem is feasible too with 'HX8', but it is
     a little more difficult to set up.

     We will appreciate more feedback to be sure it works fine. Send
     us your positive or negatve experiences with this.

     HX8 works also with Hexen and other Id games, you'll find it here:

     ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/idgames/utils/serial/hx8.zip



 [5-7]: Network parameters
 =========================

     The following game parameters are changeable only by the SERVER,
     using the console and menu:

     (they also work in single player since in single player you are
      the server AND the client)

      allowjump, allowautoaim,
      respawnitem, respawnitemtime,
      respawnmonsters, respawnmonstertime,
      gravity, bloodtime, solidecorps,
      fraglimit, deathmatch
|     since 1.29 there is mush more parameter so it is not listed here.

     Of course all the player parameters works in network :
       name, color, autoaim, weaponpref, originalweaponswitch.

     See CONSOLE.TXT for more about multiplayer commands.


 [5-8]: HOW DOES LEGACY HANDLE THE MULTIPLAYER STARTS ?
 ======================================================

    Doom LEGACY supports the extended player starts defined by
    the JDS group : 4001 to 4060 for player 5 to player 64.

    Those player starts are for cooperative, looks like JDS
    wanna have 64 players cooperative games !

    Doom LEGACY supports up to 64 deathmatch starts, but the
    original Doom games used up to 10 dm starts.

    Thus, for compatibility with the existing maps, Legacy
    will use the player starts if all the deathmatch starts
    in a map are occupied. If all the player starts are
    occupied (including extended ones), then a dm start
    chosen randomly will be used.. and players might get
    stuck together, but this will happen normally only
    at the beginning of games with maps with few dm starts.


 [5-9]: The new intermision screen
 =================================

    FRAGS  : the usual frags rankings

    BUCHOLZ: a chess scoring system: you earn more points,
       when you frag a good player. That is, a player that
       has a lot of frags at the end of the game. This is
       more balanced that the original frags system, because
       you can do less frags, but on good players, while
       in the original system, 'newbies' players could
       score as much frags between them. Also a good player
       won't earn a lot of points if he goes for easy targets,
       so he'll better choose an challenging enough target.
       Chess players will know this system (Boris is a very
       good chess player :)

       Seriously if F is the frag table like player i have fraged
       player j F[i][j] times. The total frags of a player i is
       F[i][1]+F[i][2]+ ... + F[i][32] we can call this Total[i]
         there bucholz of a player i is
         F[i][1]*Total[1] + F[i][2]*Total[2] + ... + F[i][32]*Total[32]

    INDIVIDUAL: the players are all compared 1 to 1, when a
       player wins he earns 3 points, if they draw they each
       get 1 point, then all the points are added and the
       winner is the one with the more points. This was
       suggested by Cristian Romero (romero-c@usa.net).
       Is is not perfect, but is already interesting enough:
       think of it more 'individual'. You have to make more frags
       compared to each other player to earn points. So you will
       want to go on players that you can make more frags, and
       forget about the ones which have already too much frags
       compared to you. Go for the victories, more than the frags.

    DEATHS: this ranking shows the players who have died the
       most!!

 [5-10]: Firewall handling
 =========================

    Legacy use udp port 5029 only and can except message from any
    port so it work perfectely with NAT (Network Address Translation)
    and such (like IPmaskareding of linux).


 ------------------------
 [6] COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS
 ------------------------

  There's a new environment variable 'DOOMWADDIR' that you can set
  to the path where the original Doom and LEGACY Doom wad files are.
  This enable to run LEGACY from any place on your harddrive, by
  default, LEGACY searches its wad files in "." dir (the current dir).

  Here's the new parameters that you can use from the command prompt.

  In DOOMATIC, you can add command-line options as a server in the
  Server menu's Add Parameters, or in the Prefs menu 'Local parms'.
  (the Local parms will be used only on your side, while the server
   parms are sent to everybody)



  Additional parameters info:
  ---------------------------

  +<any console prompt>

      You can put all console command at command line, Legacy will
      execute it first.


  -file  ** DEHACKED SUPPORT **

      Has been enhanced to load dehacked files too! It makes
      it much more easy to use deahcked patches in multiplayer,
      for example:

      -file gfx.wad snd.wad patch.deh


  -teamplay
  -teamskin

      Similar to the good old '-deathmatch', this activates team
      play by either color (teamplay) or skin (teamskin).


  -nocd


      Disable checking for the cd driver. In case you have a faulty
      cd driver, this will prevent troubles. The functionality is
      equivalent to -nomusic and -nosound.


  -dehacked <dehfile.deh> [dehfile.deh] [ect...]
  -deh

      DooM LEGACY supports the dehacked patches... of course its
      now done a more subtle way : you just specify the dehacked
      patch file at the command prompt, no need to patch the exe!

      You can specify multiple .deh files, and they will all be
      executed, on the order you have put them on the command line.


  -mb <number>

      If you run out of memory, or want more memory, this sets the
      number of megabytes of mem to allocate at Doom startup.

      The default is 8.


  -width <xxx> -height <yyy>

      If you like the pain, you can set the screen size at the
      command line instead of using the new 'Video Mode' menu.

      Doom LEGACY will switch to 320x200 if it can't find a
      corresponding mode. So remember to load your Univbe or
      equivalent for extra video modes.


  The rest is like Doom2 original, all the standard parameters
  are still functional.

 [7-5] Dehacked patch note
 =========================

     We don't check for the dehacked patch version, we added support for the
     patches version 6, it should run ok with (not too) old patches.

     If you have a problem with the version of the patch, try to convert it.
     Just load the .deh file into a recent version of Dehacked (3.0),
     and then save it again. It will then be saved as a text-file, that
     Legacy will be able to use.

     All text changes are supported, you can edit the .deh manually and
     replace strings by larger strings than the original Doom, it works.
     Sprite renaming works too, well, pretty anything :)

     If you can't run your dehacked patch with Legacy, please mail us!

 BELGIAN NOTE

     Yeeeeeeeeeehaaaaaaa! We BELGIANS are very very PROUD because our
     greatest compatriots have launched twenty custard pies to Bill
     Gates's face, and four of them have landed succesfully!!!
     (beginning February 1998)

     It's 'pastry' terrorism here in Belgium!
