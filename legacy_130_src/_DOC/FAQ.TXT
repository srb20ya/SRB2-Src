 -----------------
 [0] MISCELLANEOUS
 -----------------

 * I have the error : "Error: W_GetNumForName: STBAR not found!"
   What is it ?

   You have a old version of Doom. Just upgrade your version to 1.9.
   You can find patch to upgrade from the id software site.

 * under win95 or OS/2, I don't have enough memory. How can i handle with ?

   Tell win95 to put more dpmi memory for your dos box.
   Or use the -mb option.



 ---------------------------
 [1] MOUSE/JOYSTICK/KEYBOARD
 ---------------------------

 * My mouse/joystick does not work in Doom LEGACY.

   First, check that the mouse/joystick is activated : go at the
   console and type either 'use_mouse' (or use the respective
   menuitem) or 'use_joystick'.

   If it tells '0' or off than the mouse/joystick is not used,
   set the variable to 1. eg: 'use_mouse 1'.

   For the joystick, different values will support different
   types of joystick, check the console documentation for the
   command 'use_joystick' for more.

   Even if the mouse or joystick is activated, you have to
   set up the contols into the Setup Controls menu. That is:
   tell what use you will make of the mouse/joystick buttons.

 * I have a French keyboard layout and I cannot type any numbers.

   Just fire up the console and type "french". This switches the
   keyboard mapping to French. If you want it permanently activated,
   put the command "french" in your $HOME/.legacy/autoexec.cfg


 ---------
 [2] VIDEO
 ---------


 * Where are the other video modes ? I have only '320x200' in the
   Video Modes menu.

   DOS
   ---

   Doom LEGACY adds new video modes only if a VESA2 (or better) driver
   is present. The VESA2 driver is a standard of 'talking' between a
   program and the huge amount of different graphics cards
   available today.

   If you don't have a VESA2 driver, you can download UNIVBE, or
   SMART DISPLAY DOCTOR from

   http://www.scitechsoft.com

   or if you have an S3 based card, you can download the free
   software called 'S3VBE'.

   http://www.s3.com/bbs/shrware/s3vbe318.zip


 * The game doesn't restore the video mode I have chosen the last time
   I played Doom Legacy.

   The current video mode has to be made the 'default' so that it is
   saved to the config : press the key 'D' on the Video Options menu
   to set the current video mode the default.

  * I have some problems with OpenGL mode

   Have a look at the FAQ for OpenGL on the glLegacy web site:

   http://www.doomnation.com/gllegacy/faqe.htm

 # Linux: I only have a 1024x768 (or 800x600, 1280x1024, ...) resolution
   in fullscreen mode under X and Legacy is really really slow. Can I
   have lower resolutions like 320x200 in fullscreen mode as well?

   Probably yes. Legacy can only use the resolutions offered by the
   X-Server. So if all fullscreen modes have a very high resolution you
   have to modify /etc/XF86Config (or /etc/X11/XF86Config). Use XF86Setup
   (or the appropriate tool coming with your distribution - sax,
   xf86config, ...) to do this.
   If you do not succeed there, you can enter them manually into your
   XF86Config file. ONLY RECOMMENDED FOR USERS WHO KNOW WHAT THEY DO!
   For a short guide on how to do this, have a look at the file
   "Doublescan.txt".
   In case of doubt consult the XFree86-HOWTO (or ask your system
   administrator :).

 # Linux: I cannot have any fullscreen modes at all!

   You have only modes above 1024x768 in your XF86Config. Proceed as
   described above.

 # Linux: After a certain idle time my screensaver jams the display of
   Legacy. I can still operate Legacy, but I do not see what's happening
   and the screensaver won't go away.

   You probably have KDE. The KDE screensaver does not obey the screensaver
   rules (at least mine, version 1.1). The solution is to deactivate the
   KDE screensaver and use another screensaver (like the xscreensaver,
   e.g.). But the hell, when you started Legacy you should have played it
   as well and not left it alone!!!

 ---------
 [3] SOUND
 ---------

 + I can't have CD audio music, why ?

   Make sure that the MSCDEX driver version 2.0 or later is loaded.
   If it says 'MSCDEX version xxx' at game startup, and you still
   don't hear the cd music, then probably your card doesn't respond
   when Legacy tries to set the cd volume. If so, make sure your sound
   card's mixer have the cd volume set up so that you can hear something.

 + When the CD plays, the game is very 'jerky'. It doesn't do that when
   I type 'cd off' in the console.

   You have an old/bad cd driver, that can take up to a second to
   respond to cd driver commands. Either get the latest version of
   your driver, or turn cd update off. Check 'cd_udpate' in the
   console documentation for more.

 * How can I *ALWAYS* disable the sounds or music of the game ?

   Edit the sound.cfg file and set digicard/midicard to 0 (none)


 * My sterero sound is reversed, how can I set it the right way ?

   Change the console variable 'stereoreverse' to either 1 or 0.
   Or, you can edit the sound.cfg file, and set the 'flip_pan' variable.


 * The sounds are too 'slow', or 'low-pitched'

   It seems to be a problem of the auto-detection of some 8bit sound
   cards. You will have to set manually the 'sb_freq' value in the
   sound.cfg file to a lower value : 11906, 16129.


 * Music does not seem to work with General Midi.

   The sound driver that Doom LEGACY uses doesn't seem to support
   General Midi through the MPU port. You'll have to use the midi
   of your sound card.


 * Doom LEGACY doesn't play any sound/music, but I have a sound blaster
   genuine/compatible card.

   If you have a genuine or compatible SoundBlaster card, it is very
   important that you set the BLASTER environment variable.

   If you are playing under DOS, and never installed your sound card
   under DOS, run the setup of your sound card for DOS.

   Check if the BLASTER variable was set: type 'SET' under dos
   (or DOSbox)

   Do you see something like 'BLASTER=A220 I5 D1 ...' ?

   Yes? If you don't hear sounds/music, then tweak the settings in the
   sound.cfg file until you get something, first try changing the
   type of the sound card, it is not always properly detected.

   No? You have to set this variable in order that your sound card is
   detected. Run the setup that was shipped with your sound card, and
   make sure you run the setup for DOS too, it will usually add a
   line of the type 'SET BLASTER=... ...' in the autoexec.bat file.


 * How can I have better midi music on my 8bit sound card ?

   Use the DIGMID driver, it is supported in Doom Legacy.

   What the hell is this ? Well, the Gravis Ultrasound uses digital
   samples to play midi music. On a simple 8bit card, you can use digital
   samples too, which will sound usually better than what is output
   by the poor fm synthesis chip of 8bit cards.

   You will need to get a Gravis Ultrasound patch set, you can find
   several ones for free on internet, it consists of a bunch of '.pat'
   files which are the digital samples to play the midi instruments
   (eg: piano, conga, guitar, ect.).

   Check the Allegro homepage for some links to GUS patches:
   http://www.talula.demon.co.uk/allegro/

   Now to activate the DIGMID driver:

   Set the 'midi_card' value to 8 (DIGMID) in the sound.cfg file.
   Make sure you leave the 'digi_voices' blank, or set it to a low
   value, because the midi music will use digital voices.
   At the end of the sound.cfg file, set the 'patches' value
   to the path, where you have installed a Gravis Ultrasound midi
   patch set. eg: patches = d:\music\midipat\

 # Linux: CD music does not work or only works when run as root.

   We do not encourage you to run Legacy as root (you never know
   what Legacy can do to your system - it's a mighty piece of code :).
   There is a common problem with ATAPI CD-rom drives, which are
   treated as harddisks. Usually there is a link /dev/cdrom pointing to
   device hd[b,c,d]. As harddisks are not supposed to be read directly
   via this device (especially not by a common user), there are no read
   permissions for "all". For CD-roms you can savely set read permissions
   unless you are very paranoid. Assuming your CD-rom drive is /dev/hdc,
   set permissions with "chmod +r /dev/hdc" (as root). SCSI CD-rom drives
   should not have this problem. But if they do, proceed as described
   with ATAPI drives.

 # Linux: The CD music volume is not set properly.

   Go to the console and type "jigglecdvolume 1".

 -----------
 [4] NETWORK
 -----------

 * How can I run Legacy over the modem ?

   Doom LEGACY under DOS is still compatible with the old network interface
   like IPXSETUP and SERSETUP. But some new programs who replace SERSETUP
   don't support big enough packet sizes (the bigger is 512 byte),
   So ypou an try to use -packetsize parameter to set maximum packetsize of
   legacy.

   You can still play with SERSETUP, but of course it won't allow
   more than 2 players.

 * Where can I find Internet servers ?

   For the moment there is no public servers. Here is only a beta of what
   we are trying to do.

 * Under Win98 it tell my : "No tcp/ip driver detected". Why ?

   Unfortunatly the library we use don't support winsock 2.0. We hope the
   next version of this library will support Winsock 2.0. Anyway the
   incoming Win32 version will support all version of winsock.

 * When I start Doom Legacy with -server or -connect it say :
    "BinToPort: Address already in use (EADDRINUSE)"

   It appears only when Doom Legacy crashes or when you leave with ctrl-break.
   use -udpport 12345 (or any other free slot) on both sides (client and
   server)

 * Do you use the tcp protocol ?

   No, we use the udp protocol which is faster, but don't worry udp is a
   part of the internet protocol.



 ------------
 [5] DOOMATIC
 ------------

 * What is Doomatic ?

   DOOMATIC is a deathmatch launcher written by Fab & Boris. It was
   written long ago before the sources release. We made it for Doom2
   mainly, and we tried to put in it all the features that we always
   wanted in a deathmatch launcher.

   DOOMATIC replaces IPXSETUP, but is still compatible with the
   original Doom games, and you can even use it with most of the
   other Doom ports.

   DOOMATIC was made to simplify the nightmare of setting up
   Doom deathmatches, especially when you play with external maps,
   dehacked patches, and other Doom exes..

   It's key feature is the automatic copying of all wad, patches and
   exes through the network, to all the players that join together
   into a game.

   Check DOOMATIC.TXT for more.


 * When I change my name in Doomatic, it doesn't change in Legacy, Why ?

   Simply because Doomatic was made before Legacy, it doesn't send
   the name to Legacy, it justs records it into demos, for use with
   'LMPMAST', another utility that we made before Legacy.

   In other words, Doomatic's name is only useful to see the name of
   who's joining your game.


 * When I change my color in Doomatic, it doesn't change in Legacy. Why ?

   Again, because Doomatic was not made especially for Legacy, Legacy
   won't use the color in Doomatic, but the color you have set in the
   Multiplayer menu.

   With the original Doom games, Doomatic allow you to choose what color
   you will have (IPXSETUP used to give you always the same color).

   NOTE: Legacy will consider the player color in Doomatic for a
         *SINGLE SPECIAL CASE* : the green player of Doomatic is
         considered by Legacy to be the SERVER.

         (yes this is a hack, we will add an -server command-line
          parameter or something later)

 -------------------
 [6] Troubleshooting
 -------------------

 * I have the error : "Error: W_GetNumForName: STBAR not found!"
   What is it ?

   You have a old version of Doom. Just upgrade your version to 1.9.
   You can find patch to upgrade from the id software site.

 # Linux: Legacy is hung in fullscreen mode and won´t let me leave.
   What shall I do?

   Some people press the reset button, but hey, we are not in the
   stoneage of operating systems! There are two "proper" ways to
   get out: kill your X-Server. You can usually do this by pressing
   "CTRL-ALT-BACKSPACE". But if you have other open applications with
   important data (probably hacked away on your diploma thesis for 3
   weeks without saving once) you can also kill Legacy directly. Press
   "CTRL-ALT-F2" and you will get to a console. Log in, type
   "killall llxdoom" and switch back to the X-Server with "CTRL-ALT-F7".
   Some X-Server crash on this procedure - blame the X-Server for the
   loss of 3 weeks work on your diploma thesis :)
