SDL : sound support

To make this work, you have to use make with the following
parameters:

make LINUX=1 HAVE_MIXER=1

Without HAVE_MIXER, music is not handled directly by SDL;
I suppose the result is no music at all (did not test it yet).
You will also need SDL-1.1.2 minimum, SDL_Mixer, and timidity patches.

Enjoy !
