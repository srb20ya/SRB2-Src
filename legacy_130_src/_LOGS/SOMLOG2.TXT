-- 5/3/2000:
  * p_setup.c, r_data.c:
    Moved flat caching to p_setup.c like Boris suggested so it can use levelflats without any
    global variables or externs.


-- 4/26/2000:
  * p_spec.c, doomdata.h:
    Added a new linedef flag (0x400) which allows any mobj (except projectiles)
    to activate W* linedefs.
  * r_data.c, p_setup.c:
    Created two little functions that can give other files access to levelflats and 
    numlevelflats without externs (although, I think it might just be faster to cache the flats
    in p_setup.c...


-- 4/20/2000:
  * r_bsp.c:
    Fixed a bug that caused Win32 Legacy to crash when you went under 270 type water.
  * r_things.c:
    Fixed a bug that caused translucent sprites to render strange when viewed in colormapped     sectors from different angles..


-- 4/18/2000:
  * r_data.c:
    Fixed a precaching bug that caused crashes on other platforms.
  * r_bsp.c, r_defs.h, r_draw8.c, r_main.c, r_plane.c, r_segs.c, r_state.h, r_things.h:
    Removed old extra_colormap code and replaced it with faster code that takes full advantage
    of boom's colormaps using the boom code. The only modified drawing routine now is     R_DrawTranslucentColumn_8 because it needs to reference dc_colormap to be proporly rendered
    with colormaps (sorry boris, this is done in the boom code as well...)


-- 4/15/2000:
  * r_data.c:
    Fixed a little bug that would cause Legacy to quit of a wad used FF_START and F_END (i.e
    Darkening E2).
  * p_saveg.c, p_saveg.h:
    Fixed a few save game problems with Generic stairs and mobj friction.
  * r_bsp.c, p_map.c, p_maputl.c, r_defs.h, p_spec.c:
    Revamped the fakefloor system so that it no longer needs to update every fake floor every
    tick and it clips fake floors as solid "chunks" insted of just flat planes.

-- 4/13/2000:
  * w_wad.h, w_wad.c, r_data.c, r_data.h:
    Fixed a bug in the flat management system by creating a new system that scans wad files for
    F_START/F_END or FF_START/FF_END entries and creates a list of the starting position for 
    flats in each wad file. If no markers for flats are found, it will use the entire wad file
    for flat searches. This fixes a bug in the old system and makes it much cleaner. I also
    ported the colormap searches to this system and cleared up about 100 lines (or so) of code
    in w_wad.c. It works 100% and I can find no bugs (so I removed the #ifdefs and made the 
    code final).
  * r_plane.h, r_plane.c, r_bsp.c, r_segs.c:
    Removed all my old code for rendering Fake floors with planes. I'm going to start copying
    the edge code for doing this soon...



-- 4/11/2000:
  * g_game.c:
    Fixed an initialization bug (related to Boom's sector nodes) that caused the game to crash.
  * p_map.c:
    Fixed a bug that caused non-solid things to be "kicked" by the player.



-- 4/10/2000:
  * p_local.h, p_map.c, p_mobj.c:
    Added extra parameter to P_TryMove to allow some things to fall off ledges when they are
    being pushed (i.e. by conveyer belts).
  * p_saveg.c:
    Fixed a few savegame related problems: floor and ceiling flat offsets were not being saved.
  * r_bsp.c:
    If the chasecam is acitive, R_FakeFlat uses it for under/above water calculations.



-- 4/8/2000:
  * info.c:
    Fixed a crashing bug when the game tried to cache a sprite it did not have a name for.
    Added sprite name "TNT1" to the spritenames list.
  * r_things.c:
    Added boom code that does not go past the end of the draw seg array when scaning for 
    obscuring segs.
  * w_wad.c:
    Did a little cleanup work on W_CacheLumpNum made it run a little faster. Also added better
    lumpnum checking and more descriptive error messages.



-- 4/7/2000:
  * m_menu.c:
    Fixed a problem with large title graphics being offset and wraping around the screen..
  * p_maputl.c, p_mobj.c, p_setup.c:
    Fixed a problem with touching sector lists...
  * p_mobj.c:
    Added state cycle detection.
  * p_mobj.c:
    Fixed a possible demo sync problem.
  * p_mobj.c:
    Fixed a few misc. crashing bugs...


-- 4/6/2000:
  * p_local.h, p_maputl.c:
    Finally got touching sector nodelists working!
  * p_maputl.c:
    Removed intercept limit.
  * w_wad.c:
    Made W_ColormapNumForName search backwards for colormaps.



-- 4/4/2000:
  * d_main.c, dehacked.c, dehacked.h:
    Added the ability to read DEHACKED lumps in a wad file.
  * p_setup.c, p_spec.c, r_bsp.c:
    Added a new linedef type 272 which applies the middletexture colormap to any tagged sector.



-- 4/3/2000
  * p_mobj.c:
    Fixed a problem with a bullet hitting a wall when the only valid side is the second side
    and the backsector's ceilingpic is skyflatnum.
  * p_mobj.c:
    Fixed the bug where rockets and bullet puffs would hit a sky ceiling.
  * r_bsp.c, r_defs.h, r_plane.h, r_segs.c, r_state.h, r_things.c:
    Added global colormaps! Colormaps are now rendered in the sector no matter where the player
    is located.
  * r_bsp.c, r_segs.c:
    Fixed a floor/ceiling bleeding bug when one floor has a colormap and the other doesn't



-- 4/1/2000
  * started new log file with better format.
  * doomdata.h, p_spec.c:
    Added map line flag that allows any MOBJ to activate W* linedef types.
  * p_saveg.c:
    Fixed a savegame bug when a map has colormaps.
