- The date are in french format (sorry, but it's easier for me like that)

14-04-1999:
I join the DooM Legacy Team

15-04-1999:
I start coding on the OpenGL version of DooM Legacy, inspired by faB's glide code.

15-04-1999 -> 15-01-2000
The OpenGL version runs pretty well, despite this damn crappy code
- Add some new features like coronas, dynamic lighting, static lighting
- Fix some common bug between hardware/software version
- Implement in hardware mode all the missing features present in sofware mode, except splat and legacy water.
- Do a lot of join with Boris' code
- Now, I'm actually working on md2 models, mirrors and T&L
- TODO: improve the static/dynamic lighting code, support skin colors, complete this log file,...
