The makefile contains the information about the target products
available.

Note:  Makefile.cfg contains macros for various tools used during
the build process.  Of particular note:  some folks use the echo.exe
that is available from the DJGPP (or other) site(s).  Others may not
have installed this, and therefore calls to echo during the build
will use the built-in DOS echo command.  When attempting to echo a
blank line, the arguments to these two echo commands are different.
Therefore, makefile.cfg contains the macro ECHOBLANK.  Please set
this macro according to the needs of your environment.  If you change
this in makefile.cfg, it will be picked up by all other project
makefiles.

Type 'make' to see a list of targets. When the 'install'
target is made, the libgdb.a will be copied into your $(DJDIR)/lib
directory.  In addition, the i386-stub.h file will be copied into
your $(DJDIR)/include directory.  The uninstall target will remove
these files.
