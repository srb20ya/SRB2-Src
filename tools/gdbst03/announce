GDB Stub for DJGPP 0.1 Announcement
===================================

GDB Stub for DJGPP Copyright 2000 by Jonathan Brogdon

Hello.

    I'd like to announce the GDB Stub for DJGPP for DJGPP, the latest version of
a GDB stub for DJGPP targets. The GDB Stub for DJGPP conforms to the GNU GDB stub
interface as specified in the GDB User's Manual.  It allows for debugging of a
DJGPP target remotely over a serial link with GDB.

    It comes with an example program for demonstrating remote debugging of
DJGPP targets, and documentation (man and HTML pages).

    The GDB Stub for DJGPP is distributed under the GNU Library General Public License
(LGPL).

    If you have any questions relating to libsocket, please mail me and I'll
be happy to help.

    Thanks,

    Jonathan Brogdon
