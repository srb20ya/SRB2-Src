Here it is! SRB2 Final Demo 1.08 source code!

You'll need FMOD to compile this sucker (www.fmod.org).
VC++ 6.0 project file is included.
No warranty, support, etc. of any kind is offered,
just plain old as is.
Some bits of code are still really scary.
If you're planning a big project based off of this,
use 1.08 to learn what you're doing, then
base your game off of the forthcoming 1.10 source.
Go nuts!
