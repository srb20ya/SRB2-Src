	"Two months had passed since Dr. Eggman\n"\
	"tried to take over the world using his\n"\
	"Ring Satellite.\n#",

	"As it was about to drain the rings\n"\
	"away from the planet, Sonic burst into\n"\
	"the Satellite and for what he thought\n"\
	"would be the last time, defeated\n"\
	"Dr. Eggman.\n#",

	"\nWhat Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles had\n"\
	"not anticipated was that Eggman would\n"
	"return, bringing an all new threat.\n#",

	"About once every year, a strange asteroid\n"\
	"hovers around the planet. it suddenly\n"\
	"appears from nowhere, circles around, and\n"\
	"- just as mysteriously as it arrives, it\n"\
	"vanishes after about two months.\n"\
	"No one knows why it appears, or how.\n#",

	"\"Curses!\" Eggman yelled. \"That hedgehog\n"\
	"and his ridiculous friends will pay\n"\
	"dearly for this!\" Just then his scanner\n"\
	"blipped as the Black Rock made its\n"\
	"appearance from nowhere. Eggman looked at\n"\
	"the screen, and just shrugged it off.\n#",

	"It was only later\n"\
	"that he had an\n"\
	"idea. \"The Black\n"\
	"Rock usually has a\n"\
	"lot of energy\n"\
	"within it... if I\n"\
	"can somehow\n"\
	"harness this, I\n"\
	"can turn it into\n"\
	"the ultimate\n"\
	"battle station,\n"\
	"and every last\n"\
	"person will be\n"\
	"begging for mercy,\n"\
	"including Sonic!\"\n#",

	"\n\nBefore beginning his scheme,\n"\
	"Eggman decided to give Sonic\n"\
	"a reunion party...\n#",

	"\"We're ready to fire in 15 seconds!\"\n"\
	"The robot said, his voice crackling a\n"
	"little down the com-link. \"Good!\"\n"\
	"Eggman sat back in his Egg-Mobile and\n"\
	"began to count down as he saw the\n"\
	"GreenFlower city on the main monitor.\n#",

	"\"10...9...8...\"\n"\
	"Meanwhile, Sonic was tearing across the\n"\
	"zones, and everything became nothing but\n"\
	"a blur as he ran around loops, skimmed\n"\
	"over water, and catapulted himself off\n"\
	"rocks with his phenomenal speed.\n#",

	"\"5...4...3...\"\n"\
	"Sonic knew he was getting closer to the\n"\
	"City, and pushed himself harder. Finally,\n"\
	"the city appeared in the horizon.\n"\
	"\"2...1...Zero.\"\n#",

	"GreenFlower City was gone.\n"\
	"Sonic arrived just in time to see what\n"\
	"little of the 'ruins' were left. Everyone\n"\
	"and everything in the city had been\n"\
	"obliterated.\n#",

	"\"You're not quite as dead as we thought,\n"\
	"huh? Are you going to tell us your plan as\n"\
	"usual or will I 'have to work it out' or\n"\
	"something?\"                         \n"\
	"\"We'll see... let's give you a quick warm\n"\
	"up, Sonic! JETTYSYNS! Open fire!\"\n#",

	"Eggman took this\n"\
	"as his cue and\n"\
	"blasted off,\n"\
	"leaving Sonic\n"\
	"and Tails behind.\n"\
	"Tails looked at\n"\
	"the ruins of the\n"\
	"Greenflower City\n"\
	"with a grim face\n"\
	"and sighed.           \n"\
	"\"Now what do we\n"\
	"do?\", he asked.\n#",

	"\"Easy! We go\n"\
	"find Eggman\n"\
	"and stop his\n"\
	"latest\n"\
	"insane plan.\n"\
	"Just like\n"\
	"we've always\n"\
	"done, right?                 \n\n"\
	"...                    \n\n"\
	"\"Tails,what\n"\
	"*ARE* you\n"\
	"doing?\"\n#",

	"\"I'm just finding what mission obje...\n"\

	"the robot's primary objective. It says,\n"\

"What are we waiting for? The first emerald is ours!" Sonic was about to
run, when he saw a shadow pass over him, he recognized the silhouette
instantly.
	"Knuckles!" Sonic said. The echidna stopped his glide and landed
facing Sonic. "What are you doing here?"
	He replied, "This crisis affects the Floating Island,
if that explosion I saw is anything to go by."
	"If you're willing to help then... let's go!"
